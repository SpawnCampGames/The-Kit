## 🧰The-Kit
The-Kit is *SpawnCampGame's* official Unity **Sandbox** project.  

> A beginner-friendly Unity Template great for learning, prototyping, or even as a starter project.  
> It features common Unity packages along with basic custom materials, textures, models, and more.  
To keep the project small and simple we've excluded many assets that we would have normally included.

<sub>! check out our [recommended asset list](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/blob/main/Documentation/README.md#recommended-assets) in the documentation.</sub>

> [!Note]
> Made with **_Unity 6000.0.0f1_**

#### DOCUMENTATION 📘
Need help?  

While we *try* to keep our code organized and *well* documented there's much more information in the docs.  
The-Kit's Documentation provides breakdowns and other useful information about our custom systems and setups.  
[Go to our Documentation Here.](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/blob/main/Documentation/README.md)

For seamless integration with our custom assets, ensure to include our namespace:  
```csharp
using SPWN;
```
