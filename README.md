## The-Kit
The-Kit is SpawnCampGame's official Unity **Sandbox** project.
> It's a foundational Unity project featuring common Unity packages along with basic custom materials, textures, models, and more.
Many packages are recommended for a new prototyping project but to keep the project simple we've avoided using any of them within our sample scenes.
For a list of packages we recommend having please see our [recommended asset list](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/blob/main/Documentation/README.md#recommended-assets) within the Documentation.

### The-Features
- Materials
- Sprites
- Textures
- 3D Meshs
- Scripts

### Comes in Two Flavors
- URP (Universal Renderer Pipeline)
- BIRP (Built-in Renderer Pipeline)

## The-Installation
- Clone the **URP** or **BIRP** repository to your computer and Open the Project in Unity.
- Download repository as zip, extract, add the *root* folder to your Unity Hub, and Open the Project in Unity.
- Download `SPWN_TheKit.unitypackage` in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/releases) section and Import in Unity.

> [!Important]
> When importing as Unity Package, Untick the unneeded pipeline.
> All `SPWN` custom assets are available in both versions.

## The-Documentation ðŸ“˜
Need help?  

While we *try* to keep our code organized and *well* documented there's much more information in the docs.  
The-Kit's Documentation provides breakdowns and other useful information about our custom systems and setups.  
[Go to our Documentation Here.](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/blob/main/Documentation/README.md)

For seamless integration with our custom assets, ensure to include our namespace:  
```csharp
using SPWN;
```
