# The-Kit
> "The Kit" is SpawnCampGame's official Unity sandbox project.
> It's a foundational Unity project featuring common Unity packages along with basic custom materials, textures, models, and more.

## The-Kit comes in two flavors:
- URP (Universal Renderer Pipeline)
- BIRP (Built-in Renderer Pipeline)

### Features Basic Assets:
- Materials
- Sprites
- Textures
- 3D Meshs
- Scripts

For seamless integration with our custom assets, ensure to include our namespace:  
```csharp
using SPWN;
```

> [!Important]
> When importing as Unity Package:  
> `The-Kit_SpawnCampGames.unitypackage`  
> Untick the unwanted pipeline.

> [!Note]
> All `SPWN` custom assets are available in both versions.
