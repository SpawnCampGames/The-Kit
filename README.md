## 🧰The-Kit
The-Kit is *SpawnCampGame's* official Unity **Sandbox** project.  

> A beginner-friendly Unity Template great for learning, prototyping, or even as a starter project.  
> It features common Unity packages along with basic custom materials, textures, models, and more.  
To keep the project small and simple we've excluded many assets that we would have normally included.

<sub>! check out our [recommended asset list](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/blob/main/Documentation/README.md#recommended-assets) in the documentation.</sub>

#### FEATURES
- Materials
- Sprites
- Textures
- 3D Meshs
- Scripts

#### 🍦 Comes in Two Flavors
- URP (Universal Renderer Pipeline)
- BIRP (Built-in Renderer Pipeline)

#### INSTALLATION 💾
- Clone the **URP** or **BIRP** repository to your computer and Open the Project in Unity.
- Download repository as zip, extract, add the *root* folder to your Unity Hub, and Open the Project in Unity.
- Download `SPWN_TheKit.unitypackage` in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/releases) section and Import in Unity.

> [!Important]
> When importing as Unity Package, Untick the unneeded pipeline.  
> All `SPWN` custom assets are available in both versions.

#### DOCUMENTATION 📘
Need help?  

While we *try* to keep our code organized and *well* documented there's much more information in the docs.  
The-Kit's Documentation provides breakdowns and other useful information about our custom systems and setups.  
[Go to our Documentation Here.](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/The-Kit/blob/main/Documentation/README.md)

For seamless integration with our custom assets, ensure to include our namespace:  
```csharp
using SPWN;
```
